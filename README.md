This repository contains a PHP function that has a bug related to the incorrect return value when checking for the presence of 0 in an array.  The function is intended to return 0 if 0 exists within the array and 1 if it doesn't.  The bug is demonstrated and a solution is provided. The bug is subtle and demonstrates unexpected behavior due to how PHP handles type comparisons within the foreach loop.
